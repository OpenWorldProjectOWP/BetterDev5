## My process

I started this project with setting up the HTML. After figuring out how I was going to shape the page I was able to set up the containers that I would need to move into styling the page. Moving into CSS I started styling from the outside -> in, and from top to bottom. This way I would be able to manage sizing as I worked through the project. I struggled a little at first and had to walk away from it. I realized I had made some small mistakes by overthinking the design aspect so I was able to return to it an make the changes to simplify and complete the design. After the design was complete I went through the HTML and CSS to find any unused classes, then inserted comments to help others undestand what they were looking at.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had an interesting experience when changing the view to mobile. My card container had completely collapsed while the texts and svgs had remained the exact same as before. I then adjusted the "width" property on the container from using a percentage "%" to using a fixed width "px" and it corrected itself. So, I learned that using a percentage on a container isn't always a good idea. It may be best to use fixed widths and just insert @medias if needed.

### Continued development

Very few projects of mine actually use scripts (neither does this one). So, outside of wanting to perfect my markup and CSS skills I want to take some time off from projects to learn more JavaScript. I think that it is the natural progression of skills and I am eager to learn about JQ and React which won't make any sense without knowing JS.

### Useful resources

As always I think that being a professional Google-er is beyond helpful when it comes to researching obstacles when coding. I usually follow anything by MOZ or w3. 10/10 best form of documentation I've used so far.
